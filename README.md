## [[INFR11145] ](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxinfr11145.htm) Text Technologies for Data Science Group Project 2017-18
This repo contains the code and some of the data used for our TTDS **Movie Genre Classification using Subtitles** group project. The repo also contains our [final report](https://github.com/xsrust/ttds_group/blob/master/ttds-group-project.pdf).

There are three main folders:
- ```jsons``` contains two jsons created using Scrapy that link movies titles with their IMDb ID and genre(s). There is another json inside the classification folder that contains both of these joined.
- ```subtitles-module``` contains the code used for the data collection and data processing part of this project. For more information on this check the readme in the [subtitles-module folder](https://github.com/xsrust/ttds_group/tree/master/subtitles-module).
- ```classification``` contains the code used for the classification task. For more information on this check the readme on this folder.  For more information on this please check the readme in the [classification folder](https://github.com/xsrust/ttds_group/tree/master/classification).
